# Why-Functional-Programming-Matters
函数式编程原始论文Why Functional Programming Matters 中文版翻译

This paper dates from 1984, and circulated as a Chalmers memo for many
years. Slightly revised versions appeared in 1989 and 1990 as [Hug90] and
[Hug89]. This version is based on the original Chalmers memo nroff
source, lightly edited for LaTeX and to bring it closer to the published versions,and with one or two errors corrected. Please excuse the slightly oldfashioned type-setting, and the fact that the examples are not in Haskell!
